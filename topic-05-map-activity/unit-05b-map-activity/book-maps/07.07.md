## Listening for Marker Drag Events

To get this to work, we need further capabilities in MapsActivity.

First, implement a new interface:

## MapsActivity

~~~
class MapsActivity : AppCompatActivity(), OnMapReadyCallback,  GoogleMap.OnMarkerDragListener {
~~~

This interface requires three methods:

~~~
  override fun onMarkerDragStart(marker: Marker) {
  }

  override fun onMarkerDrag(marker: Marker) {
  }

  override fun onMarkerDragEnd(marker: Marker) {
    location.lat = marker.position.latitude
    location.lng = marker.position.longitude
    location.zoom = map.cameraPosition.zoom
  }
~~~

We are only interested in one of these methods for the moment.

We need modify the onMapReady method to make sure we are listening for this event:

~~~
  override fun onMapReady(googleMap: GoogleMap) {
    ...
    map.setOnMarkerDragListener(this)
    ...
  }
~~~

Finally, we need to intercept the back button, and send it back to the parent activity:

~~~
  override fun onBackPressed() {
    val resultIntent = Intent()
    resultIntent.putExtra("location", location)
    setResult(Activity.RESULT_OK, resultIntent)
    finish()
    super.onBackPressed()
  }
~~~

Try this now - and verify that if you change the location - and then immediately press back and then renter the map again. The location should be remembered, and the map centred to the new location.
