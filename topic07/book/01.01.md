# Exercises

## Exercise 1

Change back to using the PlacemarkMemStore instead of PlacemarkStoreRoom. The only change you need to make should be in MainApp.

Try some experiments to make sure the persistence is working as expected:

- Using MemStore - create some placemarks and then kill the app. Relaunch, and verify that all placemarks are gone
- Using RoomStore - try the same experiment. This time the placemarks should persist between application terminations.

### Solution

To switch between the database and memory stores - it should be just a matter of commenting out one of the placemarks declarations:

### Using database:

~~~
   // placemarks = PlacemarkMemStore()
    placemarks = PlacemarkStoreRoom (applicationContext)
~~~


### Using memory:
~~~
    placemarks = PlacemarkMemStore()
    // placemarks = PlacemarkStoreRoom (applicationContext)
~~~


## Exercise 2

Currently we have no way of deleting placemarks. To support delete, you will need to extend the PlacemarkStore to support removal of placemarks, and then implement this in PlacemarkMemStore and PlacemarkStoreRoom. 

These are the implementations you will need to support delete from the model:

# PlacemarkStore

~~~
  fun delete(placemark: PlacemarkModel)
~~~

## PlacemarkMemStore

~~~
  override fun delete(placemark: PlacemarkModel) {
    placemarks.remove(placemark)
  }
~~~

## PlacemarkDao

~~~
  @Delete
  fun deletePlacemark(placemark: PlacemarkModel)
~~~

## PlacemarkStoreRoom

~~~
  override fun delete(placemark: PlacemarkModel) {
    bg {
      dao.deletePlacemark(placemark)
    }
  }
~~~

To trigger the actual deletion, three possible strategies could be used:

- Introduce a new `delete` button alongside the `cancel` button on the PlacemarkActivity
- Support `long press` on a placemark in PlacemarkListActivity
- Support `swipe` on a placemark in PlacemarkListActivity

Implement one of these strategies

### Solution

## PlacemarkAdapter

A new method in the PlacemarkListener:

~~~
interface PlacemarkListener {
  fun onPlacemarkClick(placemark: PlacemarkModel)
  fun onPlacemarkLongClick(placemark: PlacemarkModel)
}
~~~


## Also in PlacemarkAdapter

Configure the inteVIew to install the long click listener:

~~~
      itemView.setOnLongClickListener { listener.onPlacemarkLongClick(placemark); true }
~~~

## PlacemarkListActivity

Implement this method in PlacemarkListActivty:

~~~
  override fun onPlacemarkLongClick(placemark: PlacemarkModel) {
    app.placemarks.delete(placemark)
    loadPlacemarks()
  }

~~~

Test all of this now.

We might give the user a change to change her mind:


~~~
  override fun onPlacemarkLongClick(placemark: PlacemarkModel) {
    val title = ctx.getString(R.string.dialog_title_delete)
    val message = ctx.getString(R.string.dialog_desc_delete)

    alert(message, title) {
      positiveButton(ctx.getString(android.R.string.ok)) {
        app.placemarks.delete(placemark)
        loadPlacemarks()
      }
      negativeButton(ctx.getString(android.R.string.no)) { }
    }.show()
  }
~~~

This should put up a dialog to allow deletion to be canceled.

## Kotlin Version

Finaly, we might take the opportunity to bump the kotlin version in `build.gradle`

It currently might be:

~~~
  ext.kotlin_version = '1.2.10'
~~~

Change it to:

~~~
  ext.kotlin_version = '1.2.21'
~~~
