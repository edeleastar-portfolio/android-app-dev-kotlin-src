# Run

Make sure you can build and run the project. When you first attempt to run the app, you will be asked to create a Virtual Machine. You might create a VM configured like this:

Which will appear in a list of VMs like this:

The version, size and resolution are a reasonable compromise. 

If it launches successfully, if should look like this in the VM:

## .gitignore

If you are using git, you might want to make the following small adjustments to the generated .gitignore file:

~~~
*.iml
.gradle
/local.properties
/.idea
.DS_Store
/build
/captures
.externalNativeBuild
~~~

(we are excluding all .idea files)

If you are using git, it is a good idea to commit the project to a repository now.
