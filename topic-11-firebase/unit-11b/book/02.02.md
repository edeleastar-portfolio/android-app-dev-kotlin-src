# Image Management

Currently we load all of the images using a helper method we have written for this purpose. We will replace this now with the Glide library:

- <https://github.com/bumptech/glide>

This will work as as currently, but additionally it will also work with url of images on the public Internet. This will be part of our move to firebase later in this lab.


First, we define the version of Glide we wish to use:

## build.gradle

~~~
...
  glide_version = '4.8.0'
  ...
  implementation "com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:$glide_version"
  ...
...
~~~

Now we can introduce the glide library wherever we are displaying images:

## PlacemarkAdapter

Replace:

~~~
      itemView.imageIcon.setImageBitmap(readImageFromPath(itemView.context, placemark.image))
~~~

with

~~~
      Glide.with(itemView.context).load(placemark.image).into(itemView.imageIcon);
~~~

## PlacemarkView

Replace:

~~~
    placemarkImage.setImageBitmap(readImageFromPath(this, placemark.image))
~~~

with

~~~
    Glide.with(this).load(placemark.image).into(placemarkImage);
~~~

## PlacemarkMqpView

Replace:

~~~
     imageView.setImageBitmap(readImageFromPath(this, placemark.image))
~~~

with:

~~~
    Glide.with(this).load(placemark.image).into(imageView);
~~~

Rebuild and test the app now. It should behave as before.

## PlacemarkMapPresenter

We need one other small adjustment - currently we have this line in PlacemarkMapPresenter::doPopulateMap()

~~~
      map.addMarker(options).tag = it.id
~~~

This stores a tag to refer to the placemark associated with the marker we have just placed on the map. Change this to the following:

~~~
      map.addMarker(options).tag = it
~~~

Now in PlacemarkMapPresenter::onMarkerSelected(), replace

~~~
      val tag = marker.tag as Long
      val placemark = app.placemarks.findById(tag)
~~~

with

~~~
      val placemark = marker.tag as PlacemarkModel
~~~


The reason we are making this adjustment is because of the Firebase adjustments we will shortly make to the PlacemarkModel
