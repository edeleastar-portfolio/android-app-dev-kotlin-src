The logged in user details are reasonably easy to locate:

- <https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/manage-users>

Here is how we could access this in kotlin:

~~~
    val user = FirebaseAuth.getInstance().currentUser
    var appTitle = "${title.toString()}: ${user!!.email}"
~~~

## Solution

## PlacemarkListActivity

In onCreate - we can extend the title as follows:

~~~
...
    val user = FirebaseAuth.getInstance().currentUser
    var appTitle = "${title.toString()}: ${user!!.email}"
    toolbarMain.title = appTitle
    setSupportActionBar(toolbarMain)
...
~~~
