# Preparing for Firebase

We need to make a number of small changes to the application in order to prepare for incorporating Firebase storage of placemarks.

# Managing the Firebase ID

In PlacemarkModel, we need an additional ID - fbId - to record the Firebase ID of each placemark. Unlike the existing id, which is a Long, the firebase id is a string:

## PlacemarkModel 

~~~
data class PlacemarkModel(@PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) var id: Long = 0,
                          var fbId : String = "",
                          var title: String = "",
                          var description: String = "",
                          var image: String = "",
                          var lat : Double = 0.0,
                          var lng: Double = 0.0,
                          var zoom: Float = 0f) : Parcelable
~~~

The id field (the Long one) is used in the PlacemarksMapsActivity to track user interaction with the markers on the map. As this id may be 0 when the placemarks are stored in Firebase, we need to change this.

## PlacemarkMapsActivity

Locate this line:

~~~
    map.addMarker(options).tag = it.id
~~~

.. and replace with:

~~~
    map.addMarker(options).tag = it
~~~


Also, locate

~~~
      val tag = marker.tag as Long
      val placemark = app.placemarks.findById(tag)
~~~

and replace with

~~~
    val placemark = marker.tag as PlacemarkModel
~~~

In the above, we are using the entire placemark as the tag, not just the id.

# Clearing Placemarks between user logins

As we are now supporting multiple logins - then we need a way of clearing the placemakrs between different users accessing the app.

## PlacemarkMemStore

~~~
  fun clear()
~~~

##PlacemarkMemStore

~~~
  override fun clear() {
    placemarks.clear()
  }
~~~

## PlacemarkStoreRoom
~~~
  override fun clear() {
  }
~~~

We keep the PlacemarkStoreRoom implementation empty for the moment.

# Image Management

Currently we load all of the images using a helper method we have written for this purpose. We will replace this now with the Glide library:

- <https://github.com/bumptech/glide>

This will work as as currently, but additionally it will also work with url of images on the public Internet. This will be part of our move to firebase later in this lab.

## PlacemarkAdapter

Replace:

~~~
      itemView.imageIcon.setImageBitmap(readImageFromPath(itemView.context, placemark.image))
~~~

with

~~~
      Glide.with(itemView.context).load(placemark.image).into(itemView.imageIcon);
~~~


## PlacemarkActivity

Replace:

~~~
      placemarkImage.setImageBitmap(readImageFromPath(this, placemark.image))
~~~

with:

~~~
      Glide.with(this).load(placemark.image).into(placemarkImage);
~~~


## PlacemarkMapsActivity

Replace:

~~~
      imageView.setImageBitmap(readImageFromPath(this@PlacemarkMapsActivity, placemark.image))
~~~

with:

~~~
      Glide.with(this@PlacemarkMapsActivity).load(placemark.image).into(imageView);
~~~
