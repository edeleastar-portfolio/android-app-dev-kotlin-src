Placemark application so far:

- [archive.zip](archives/archive.zip)


This is a revised EditLocation view:

![](img/02.png)

In this version, as you drag the marker around the lat/long is updated as the marker is moved. Try to implement this now. 

One strategy might be to replace the existing view completely with a version that loads a new layout. This layout can be designed in the layout editor, and contain the MapView + the lat/lng text views.

To kick start this process, you could copy the PlacemarkMapView class + layout. You should be able to keep the same presenter.
