# findByID

Currently we do not have any way retrieving a placemark by its ID. Having this ability is a useful utility method for a variety of scenarios.

We can start by introducing this into the PlacemarkStore and PlacemarkMemStore

## PlacemarkStore

~~~
...
  suspend fun findById(id:Long) : PlacemarkModel?
...  
~~~


## PlacemarkMemStore

~~~
...
  suspend override fun findById(id:Long) : PlacemarkModel? {
    val foundPlacemark: PlacemarkModel? = placemarks.find { p -> p.id == id }
    return foundPlacemark
  }
...  
~~~


This implements the facility only if we are using in-memory store. Now implement the same feature when we are using the database:


## PlacemarkStoreRoom

~~~
...
  override suspend fun findById(id: Long): PlacemarkModel? {
    val deferredPlacemark = bg {
      dao.findById(id)
    }
    val placemark = deferredPlacemark.await()
    return placemark
  }
...
~~~

The above will need this method in the Dao class:

## PlacemarkDao

~~~
...
  @Query("select * from PlacemarkModel where id = :arg0")
  fun findById(id: Long): PlacemarkModel
...
~~~
