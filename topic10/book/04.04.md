# LocationCallback

Still in PlacemarkActivity, include the following as a new field in the class:

## PlacemarkActivity

~~~
  var locationCallback = object : LocationCallback() {
    override fun onLocationResult(locationResult: LocationResult?) {
      info("Location Update")
    }
  }
~~~

Here we are defining a variable called `locationCallback` - which is a function to be called when a location event is received.

Introduce a new method to initiate location updates:

~~~
  @SuppressLint("MissingPermission")
  private fun startLocationUpdates() {
    locationService.requestLocationUpdates(locationRequest, locationCallback, null)
  }
~~~


Now we can trigger this method when the activity resumes (or starts) :


~~~
  override fun onResume() {
    super.onResume()
    mapView.onResume()
    startLocationUpdates()
  }
~~~

Restart the app now and monitor Logs. You should see occasional updates.
