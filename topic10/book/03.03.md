# Location Requests

Currently we request the last known location when the user presses the `Here` button:

~~~
    btnHere.setOnClickListener {
      setCurrentLocation()
    }
~~~

This calls this method:

~~~
  @SuppressLint("MissingPermission")
  fun setCurrentLocation() {
    locationService.lastLocation.addOnSuccessListener {
      defaultLocation.lat = it.latitude
      defaultLocation.lng = it.longitude
      placemark.lat = it.latitude
      placemark.lng = it.longitude
      configureMap()
    }
  }
~~~

Which performs an asynchronous request to get the latest known location. The configureMap method then ensures a marker is placed at this location:

~~~
  fun configureMap() {
    map.uiSettings.setZoomControlsEnabled(true)
    val loc = LatLng(placemark.lat, placemark.lng)
    val options = MarkerOptions().title(placemark.title).position(loc)
    map.addMarker(options)
    map.moveCamera(CameraUpdateFactory.newLatLngZoom(loc, placemark.zoom))
  }
~~~


We would like to refactor this such that it automatically display the current location - and track the user as they move around the site - updating the lat/lng on the display.

First we need a new method in LocationHelper:

## LocationHelper
~~~
@SuppressLint("RestrictedApi")
fun createDefaultLocationRequest() : LocationRequest {
  val locationRequest = LocationRequest().apply {
    interval = 10000
    fastestInterval = 5000
    priority = LocationRequest.PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY
  }
  return locationRequest
}
~~~

This is documented here:

- <https://developer.android.com/training/location/change-location-settings.html#location-request>

... the LocationRequest object is a key part of the API:

- <https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/LocationRequest>

In PlacemarkActivity, we will create one of these objects as a class member:


PlacemarkActivity

~~~
...
  val locationRequest = createDefaultLocationRequest()
...
~~~


To retrieve Location updates - this guide here provides basics:

- <https://developer.android.com/training/location/receive-location-updates.html#kotlin>


We will implement this in the next step...
