#Solution

Placemark application so far:

- [archive.zip](archives/archive.zip)

## Exercise 1:

Although the locations is being tracked, the map view is not displaying the location correctly (it still renders the default location). See if you can fix this.


## Exercise 2:

Change the behaviour of the PlacemarkActivity view when an existing placemark is edited. In this mode, the application should display the latitude/longitude - but not track the location.


## Exercise 3:

Augment the full screen map view with zoom controls.
